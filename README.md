# Data-Structures-and-algorithms-in-python<br />
This repository contains various data structures and algorithm codes in python.<br /><br />
1.Bubble Sort:<br />
Bubble sort algorithm simply compares the adjacent elements and swaps if they are not in order untill all elements are sorted. Here i have implemented the bubble sort algorithm using python and its random library.<br />
2.Merge Sort:<br/>
Merge Sort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It divides the input array into two halves, calls itself for the two halves, and then merges the two sorted halves.
